 * This class will keep track of the HijriDate and the corresponding GregorianDate. This will be a

 * Calendar.
 * TODO: Decide if HijriCalendar needs to extend java.util.Calendar.
 * It will expose the standard, before, after et. al. functions needed for a Calendar class.
 * Will have a seperate "events" map that will store events associated to the Date.
